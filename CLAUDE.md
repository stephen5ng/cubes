- Run unit tests before committing. Functional replays are heavy; prefer targeted unit tests unless explicitly updating goldens.
- Run the functional tests (run_functional_tests.sh) before committing and feature changes.
- MQTT neighbor protocol now uses numeric cube IDs with `cube/right/{sender}` and payload `"{neighbor_cube_id}"` or empty string to clear.
- P0 cube IDs: 1-6; P1 cube IDs: 11-16.
- ABC start countdown is frame-polled (not tied to incoming MQTT). Incidents are logged once per frame.
- Avoid committing large binaries or generated outputs. Use `.gitignore` to exclude `output/*`, audio assets, and credentials.
- When updating functional tests, be sure to examine the updated goldens and that you understand them. Flag any changes that don't make sense.
- Ignore everything in the `experimental` directory.
