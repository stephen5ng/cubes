"""
Test for simplified late join behavior after ABC completion.

This test verifies:
1. First player can complete ABC sequence and start countdown
2. Once first player completes countdown, ABC state is cleared for all players 
3. Second player attempting ABC connection after ABC is cleared has no effect
