"""
Test for the simplified ABC clearing logic.

This test verifies:
1. When any player completes their countdown, ABC letters are cleared from ALL cubes
2. Players who complete ABC after this happens cannot start a countdown (no ABC state exists)
3. The visual experience is clean - no ABC letters remain after someone completes countdown
