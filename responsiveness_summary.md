| **stress_0.1** | NFC Reset Removed from loop() | 30.4s | 48.1s | 14.0s | 2.1s | 🔴 POOR | ❌ FAIL | ✅ Max -41%, Avg -64% vs baseline |

## Key Insights:

### 🟡 SNG Test (Short workload):
- **Baseline problem**: Even a short 11-second test created an 11.4-second backlog
- **Impact**: Cube unresponsive for ~11 seconds after test completion
- **Improvement**: Removing NFC reset from `loop()` reduced max to ~4.6s and avg to ~0.7s, passing the test
- **Recovery**: Quick recovery once backlog cleared (~0.6s after fix)

### 🔴 STRESS_0.1 Test (Medium workload):
- **Problem**: 13.8-second test creates a massive 81.4-second message backlog  
- **Impact**: Cube severely overloaded for over 1 minute after test
- **Pattern**: Clear linear backlog processing (81s → 82ms over time)

## Root Cause Analysis:

1. **Message Accumulation**: Tests generate more messages than cubes can process in real-time
2. **FIFO Queue Processing**: Cubes process messages in strict order, causing linear backlog reduction
3. **Network vs Processing**: Issue exists even with real broker (not just localhost), indicating cube-side processing bottleneck

## Optimization Targets:

1. **Primary**: Reduce total message volume during tests
2. **Secondary**: Optimize message processing efficiency on ESP32
3. **Tertiary**: Implement message prioritization (if possible)

## Next Steps:

Use this baseline to validate improvements. Success criteria:
- **Target**: Max response time < 1000ms, Avg response time < 500ms
- **Acceptable**: Max response time < 5000ms, Avg response time < 1000ms  
- **Goal**: Pass responsiveness test (Grade: 🟢 GOOD or better)
