# Project Rules

1. **Explicit Commit Permission**: Do not commit changes without explicit user permission. "Staging" means `git add`, not `git commit`.
2. **Current State Comments Only**: Comments should explain the current state of the code. Do not use comments to describe historical changes, moved logic, or what the code "used to do" (e.g., "Logic moved to X").
